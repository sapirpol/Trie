# Trie
Tree of strings

Describtion of the project: 

This is an implementation to Trie data structure. <br />
The program reads sentences from user (ending by line consists of point) - This data will be stores in the Trie (using an array). <br />
Then, we read again lines from user - one word in a line. <br />
We search for the word in the Trie: <br />
If we found, we print it's number of accurences in the Trie, and then, reduce it by one. <br />
If we didn't find the word, we asked the user if he meant to the closest word (from the beginning) stored in the Trie. <br />
