# Trie
Tree of strings

Describtion of the project:
This is an implementation to Trie data structure.
The program reads sentences from user (ending by line consists of point) - This data will be stores in the Trie (using an array).

Then, we read again lines from user - one word in a line.

We search for the word in the Trie:
If we found, we print it's number of accurences in the Trie, and then, reduce it by one.
If we didn't find the word, we asked the user if he meant to the closest word (from the beginning) stored in the Trie.
